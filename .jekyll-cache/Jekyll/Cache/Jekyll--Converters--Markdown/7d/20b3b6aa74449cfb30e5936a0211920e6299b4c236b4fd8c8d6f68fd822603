I"Æ<p>As a recent graduate with a bachelorâ€™s degree in statistics, I am currently in search of opportunities to work in the Data Scientist / Data Analyst field full-time position. During my studies, I dedicated my free time to join in Î‘Î½Î±ÏƒÏ„Î±ÏƒÎ¹Ïƒ (Statistics Student Association of Matana University) as a secretary for two years period. Despite all of that, I took the time to start a career as a private math tutor for almost two years experiences. Hard work and determination are key aspects in defining who I am. These two experiences really helped me in sharpening my mindset by paying attention to details and making sure everything is organized and under control.</p>

<p>In my previous internship experience as a Data Scientist, me and my team have done several projects as follows:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Finding the relationship between features of a cellphone price, predicting a price range of the phone.</li>
  <li>Predicting the price of cars according to features like fuel type, horsepower, num of cylinder, etc etc.</li>
  <li>Predict how capable each loan applicant is competent by repaying the loan.</li>
  <li>Classifying image of rice leaf, on which disease the rice leaf belongs to.</li>
  <li>Understand the variables that are influencing the customers to migrate.</li>
</ol>

<p>I am excited to start this journey and see where it leads me. At this moment, I am interested in how data analyst and data scientist playing their roles of an organization.</p>
