As a recent graduate with a bachelor's degree in statistics, I am currently in search of opportunities to work in the Data Scientist / Data Analyst field full-time position. During my studies, I dedicated my free time to join in Αναστασισ (Statistics Student Association of Matana University) as a secretary for two years period. Despite all of that, I took the time to start a career as a private math tutor for almost two years experiences. Hard work and determination are key aspects in defining who I am. These two experiences really helped me in sharpening my mindset by paying attention to details and making sure everything is organized and under control. 

In my previous internship experience as a Data Scientist, me and my team have done several projects as follows:
1. Finding the relationship between features of a cellphone price, predicting a price range of the phone.
2. Predicting the price of cars according to features like fuel type, horsepower, num of cylinder, etc etc.
3. Predict how capable each loan applicant is competent by repaying the loan.
4. Classifying image of rice leaf, on which disease the rice leaf belongs to.
5. Understand the variables that are influencing the customers to migrate.


I am excited to start this journey and see where it leads me. At this moment, I am interested in how data analyst and data scientist playing their roles of an organization.
